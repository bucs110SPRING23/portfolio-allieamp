Republicans tore into President Biden’s first veto that stopped a bipartisan bill 
removing a new Labor Department rule encouraging retirement fiduciaries to consider environmental, 
social and corporate governance (ESG) issues in their investments.
Biden’s first veto came against a bipartisan bill striking down the administration’s new rule promoting
the woke ESG ideology, with the president saying his decision was due to heavy "MAGA Republican" influence 
in the bill. I just vetoed my first bill. This bill would risk your retirement savings by making it 
illegal to consider risk factors MAGA House Republicans don't like. Your plan manager should be able to 
protect your hard-earned savings — whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene likes it or not, Biden announced in a Monday tweet.
