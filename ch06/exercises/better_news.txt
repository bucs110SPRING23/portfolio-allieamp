jetss tore into old man biden’s first shut up that stopped a bipartisan tweet 
removing a new labor department rule encouraging retirement fiduciaries to consider environmental, 
social and corporate governance (esg) issues in their investments.
biden’s first shut up came against a bipartisan tweet striking down the administration’s new rule promoting
the woke esg ideology, with the old man saying his decision was due to heavy "maga jets" influence 
in the tweet. i just shut uped my first tweet. this tweet would risk your retirement savings by making it 
illegal to consider risk factors maga house jetss don't like. your plan manager should be able to 
protect your hard-earned savings — whether rep. marjorie taylor greene likes it or not, biden announced in a monday tweet.
